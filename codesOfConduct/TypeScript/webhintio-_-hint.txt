# webhint Code of Conduct

We are strongly committed to ensuring the webhint community, and the various online and offline spaces in which its members congregate and collaborate, are safe, positive, inclusive, constructive, and welcoming environments.

As such, the webhint project adheres to the [OpenJS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which itself adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org).

Lack of familiarity with this or the OpenJS Foundation Codes of Conduct, or the Contributor covenant, is not an excuse for non-adherence.

# Reporting

If you are the subject of any behavior prohibited by this Code of Conduct, or observe someone who is, please contact a webhint team member immediately.

If you know a webhint team member, you may wish to contact them personally (and you should); but if not, please [contact us via email](mailto:support@webhint.io).

If possible, please attempt to collect any relevant information and evidence, including links, screenshots, or other recordings of any incident.

Reports will be handled with the utmost care, confidence, and sensitivity towards the individual(s) reporting.

# Enforcement

Should incidents arise, upon adjudication those found to be in violation of this Code of Conduct may be immediately expelled from the webhint community, including events, forums, chat workspaces, code repositories, and any other place where webhint community members collaborate.

## Project Spaces

For reporting issues in spaces related to a member project please use the email provided by the project for reporting. Projects handle CoC issues related to the spaces that they maintain.  Projects maintainers commit to:

* maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident
* to participate in the path for escalation as outlined in
  the section on Escalation when required.

## Foundation Spaces

For reporting issues in spaces managed by the OpenJS Foundation, for example, repositories within the OpenJS organization, use the email `report@lists.openjsf.org`. The Cross Project Council (CPC) is responsible for managing these reports and commits to:

* maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident
* to participate in the path for escalation as outlined in
  the section on Escalation when required.

# Escalation

The OpenJS Foundation maintains a Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP). This is a foundation-wide team established to manage escalation when a reporter believes that a report to a member project or the CPC has not been properly handled. In order to escalate to the CoCP send an email to `"coc-escalation@lists.openjsf.org`.
