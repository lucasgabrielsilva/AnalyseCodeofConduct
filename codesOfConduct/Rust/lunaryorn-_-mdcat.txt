# Code of Conduct

I stand by the [Rust Code of Conduct][coc]; I can't make any promises about
enforcing it, but when I see you obviously violating it—here or elsewhere—I
won't hesitate to block you.  In particular I'll show you the door when you
spread hate or harass anyone, whether here or elsewhere (eg Twitter).

I have a clear idea of whom I like to contribute to this repository, and whom
_not_.

I'll edit, close or lock issues and PR, and block users at my own discretion.
