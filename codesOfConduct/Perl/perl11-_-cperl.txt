# Contributor Code of Conduct

This project adheres to **No Code of Conduct**.

We are all adults.
We accept anyone's contributions.
If you are feeling harassed speak up by yourself.
We do not censor, we don't stop any discussions.
Nothing else matters.

Compare the conflicting [p5p STANDARDS OF CONDUCT](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpolicy.html#STANDARDS-OF-CONDUCT), which was abused to silence technical criticism and demeaning technical remarks on the maintainership in the last years, and the [cperl development policies](http://perl11.github.io/cperl/perlcperl.html#Development-policies).
cperl can stand criticsm and encourages criticism, but doesn't allow abuse.
perl5 silences them via code of conduct and still is toxic and effectively dead.

For more information please see the [No Code of Conduct](https://github.com/domgetter/NCoC#what-is-ncoc) page.
