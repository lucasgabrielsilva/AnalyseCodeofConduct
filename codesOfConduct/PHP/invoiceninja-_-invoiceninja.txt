# Invoice Ninja Code of Conduct

The development team has invested a tremendous amount of time and energy into this project. While we appreciate that bugs can be frustrating we ask that our community refrain from insults and snide remarks. We're happy to provide support to both our hosted and selfhosted communities but ask that feedback is always polite.
